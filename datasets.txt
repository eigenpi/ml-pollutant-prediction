These publicly available datasets were first "cleaned". Cleaning means:
For each dataset, I pruned the first entries until I reached the 
first 24 h with complete data. After that I filled in the missing data 
with the values of exactly 24 hours before. I assume one day at any 
time will be more likely like the day before at the same time.
Pruned also the end so that I have complete entire days, each with 24 values;
in this way we keep things simple...
